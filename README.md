# KePa -- The Pipa, played on Keyboard.

Written in React, the KePa is created as a tool to try out the traditional Chinese Pipa with minimal tools.

The traditional Pipa has a history spanning 2000 years, and it has a variety of techniques.

## Usage

You can play either using the keyboard, or by clicking the strings. In keyboard mode, you can play the notes marked by the active region (the region inside the rectangle).

To toggle the active region, use the left and right keys.

The keyboard Pipa is designed to mimic the actual Pipa. The four rows on the keyboard represent the four strings in the pipa, the first string being the number row, the second string is the row that starts with 'Q', the third string is the row that starts with 'A', and the fourth string is the row that starts with 'Z'.

The keys of "1", "Q", "A", and "Z" is fixed as the 'open' strings.
