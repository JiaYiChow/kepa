# KePa -- The Pipa, played on Keyboard. 
With the KePa, you can now play the pipa without having to purchase one expensive instrument or carry a heavy instrument. (and do not worry about it going out of tune)

This program is written in javascript, and I realise I have to host it in a server of some sorts or run it in a webpage... Would be appreciated if someone can give me some ideas as to how I can create my program (or maybe give me suggestions for a better programming language to use, or suggestions in general).

##Using the KePa 
For now you have to download this and drag the index.html page to use it. 
The diagram below shows how to use it, the black represents your keyboard and the red represents the note/function:

Most probably gonna create a website where this thing works. (and maybe get some ad revenue yay)

Stay tuned! 

##Progress 
1. You can play the notes now. 

##Future plans 
1. Functionality to change octave. 
2. Functionality to change major. 
3. Functionality to record sounds :DDDDD
4. Including tremolo. (There is more than 1 way to do a tremolo, and each tremolo has different effects haha)
5. Perhaps some other miscallnaeous techniques of the pipa because the pipa is awesome（扫弦，绞弦） :D

##DEBUG 
1. Pressing any random key triggers the keyPressed function(done)
2. decreasing major is buggy 
3. chaning major and then changing octave is kinda weird
