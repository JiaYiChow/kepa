            You can play either using the keyboard, or by clicking the strings. In
            keyboard mode, you can play the notes marked by the active region (the
            region inside the rectangle).

            The keyboard Pipa is designed to mimic the actual Pipa. The four rows
            on the keyboard represent the four strings in the pipa, the first
            string being the number row, the second string is the row that starts
            with 'Q', the third string is the row that starts with 'A', and the
            fourth string is the row that starts with 'Z'.
